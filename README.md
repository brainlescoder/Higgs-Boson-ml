# Higgs-Boson-ml
It was very challenging and exciting for me to work on the dataset. Most importantly Rankorder was a huge pain. But I fairly understood it.  And it was a fun loaded challenge.  My pc couldn\'t handle such a large dataset so training time was taking little bit longer than usual.  As per my knowledge the counts of s is much less than the number of counts of b. I will probably be uploading the code soon. This has the predicted class for the HiggsBoson Dataset as per the requirement.
