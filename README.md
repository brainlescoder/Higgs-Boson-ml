# Higgs-Boson-ml
It was very challenging and exciting for me to work on the dataset. 
Most importantly Rankorder was a huge pain. But I fairly understood it.  And it was a fun loaded challenge.  
My pc couldn\'t handle such a large dataset so training time was taking little bit longer than usual.  As per my knowledge the counts of s is much less than the number of counts of b. 

This has the predicted class for the HiggsBoson Dataset as per the requirement..
